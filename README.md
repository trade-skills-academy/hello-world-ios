# Hello World iOS

This project will show you the basics of iOS development. In order to run this application you MUST be using a Mac. iOS development is something that can only be done within a Mac environment. The first thing you need to do is install Xcode, and once you have that installed simply open this directory. Once inside this directory you can simply run the app within a simulator to see the app.

All source files have been thoroughly commented, so take sometime to read through how everything works.
